description: |
  Lantern introduces and demonstrates a minimal computing approach to producing textbooks using free and open source software. Lantern provides an Pandoc template for building multiple formats of book-length educational works.
  
  - **Free:** Lantern uses open source software and free-of-charge web services for processing, building, deploying, and hosting open textbooks. 

  - **Portable:** Lantern emphasizes the use of plain text file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases or servers are required. 

  - **Multi-format:** Lantern teaches semantic markup technologies for producing Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX, and LaTeX editions of open textbooks. 

  - **Sustainable:** Lantern minimizes the infrastructure, configuration, hosting, and maintenance costs related to traditional digital publishing systems and platforms.

  - **Discoverable:** Lantern produces harvestable metadata in OAI-PMH, JSON-LD and Google Scholar tags.
